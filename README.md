3. Probably is smart to make a branch before working so that we don't overwrite main. Do this in git hub desktop
4. make any chnages, re-build, program board, etc.
5. Notify other team members if you are going to push to main, but push to your branch whenever

### To Push
1. Open github desktop
2. Find the project, give a descroption and do "commit to main"
3. Then, click the push button that appears at the top. 


## Other Notes

* The current hello_dect is the one that has working i2c
* The repo is automatically set to disable build files. You will have to re-build whenever you want to test. Local build files will remain
